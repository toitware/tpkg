# Contributing

Want to contribute to the Toit language? Great! First, read this page.

## Code of conduct

Contributing code to a community is a great way to engage. Make sure to read our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md); the foundation for our community interactions.

## Individual contributions

Before we can use your code, you must sign the an individual contributor license agreement (CLA). The CLA is
necessary mainly because you own the copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of
our codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also need to be sure of various
other things - for instance that you‘ll tell us if you know that your code infringes on other people’s
patents. You don‘t have to sign the CLA until after you’ve submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase. Before you start working on a
larger contribution, you should get in touch with us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that
we can help out and possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid frustration later
on.

## Corporate contributions

Contributions made by corporations will be covered by a different agreement than the one above. If you work
for a corporation, do let us know up front so we can get the right agreement in place.
