This directory is a git-directory.

It contains two versions of a package: v1.5.8 and v2.3.5 (checked out as
main).

Since we can't store git repositories inside other git repositories,
we have stored the `.git` directory in a zip file. The test framework
automatically extracts zip files.

When manipulating the test, it's thus generally necessary to unzip the
archive first, before changing the files.

Note that there is a second `.git_windows.zip` which is used on Windows. The
content of these git repositories is the same (although built separately on
respective platforms). This is to avoid any problems with windows/posix
conventions inside the git data structures themselves.
