This directory is a git-directory.

It has two tags:
- v2.0.0 (on 2.0.0 branch)
- v3.1.4 (master, currently checked out)

Neither of the tags is an annotated tag.

Since we can't store git repositories inside other git repositories,
we have stored the `.git` directory in a zip file. The test framework
automatically extracts zip files.

When manipulating the test, it's thus generally necessary to unzip the
archive first, before changing the files.
