This directory is a git-directory.

It has two tags:
- v1.1.0, on branch 1.1.0.
- v1.2.3 (master, currently checked out)

Both tags are annotated tags.

Since we can't store git repositories inside other git repositories,
we have stored the `.git` directory in a zip file. The test framework
automatically extracts zip files.

When manipulating the test, it's thus generally necessary to unzip the
archive first, before changing the files.
